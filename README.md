cppassi¹ -- C++-assistant
=========================

Ths program is a small helper for the creation of C++ files. Basically
what your IDE would do but without the IDE on the commandline.

This tool assumes a certain C++-style and has no intentions to enable
not following it. On the contrary, future versions may contain non-optional
checks on them (things like indentation with tabs or use of snake_case).
